# This information is intended to be machine-readable, and is never translated. 
#     type identifies the type of database object; 
#     schema is the schema name that the object belongs in, or NULL for object types that do not belong to schemas; 
#     name is the name of the object, quoted if necessary, only present if it can be used (alongside schema name, if pertinent) as an unique identifier of the object, otherwise NULL; 

 #  identity is the complete object identity, with the precise format depending on object type, and each part
# within the format being schema-qualified and quoted as necessary.
